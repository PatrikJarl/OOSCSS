Object Oriented Sass (an extention of OOCSS by Nicole Sullivan)

<h2>What is this OOSCSS thingy?</h2>

<p>As a web developer I write a lot of code. It’s really easy to write a lot code and not thinking about the effects of their outcome. Code code this, code code that = messy code that’s hard to maintain. </p>

<p>A couple years ago (2008 if I’ve got it right) Nicole Sullivan began her project with something called OOCSS. This is an abbreviation of Object Oriented Cascading Style Sheets and has the purpose to make your properties more reusable. But this approach had it’s downsides by bloating the markup with class after class after class. </p>

<p>This inspired me to investigate the opportunity to make a similar project with Sass. Using Sass as a preprocessor has some really nice features in the making of object oriented code. </p>

<p>First of, in Sass you easily declare variables. Common used stuff like colors and font-families are easily stored in reusable variables. Bam! The first step towards OOSass is made. </p>

<p>(note: this has just become available in CSS3 to. The world of web tech is moving forward as we speak.) </p>

<p>Another great feature in the Sass world is the possibility to use mixins and placeholders. </p>
